Starting to get this populated while migrating code from a private repo; prioritizing sanitizing over functionality for now.  There are currently three branches:

- monolith:  all logic in one python script, with a single config and
  a single makefile
- pre-post: some logic moved into pre and post scripts to provide more local
  flexibility
- modular: most logic moved into replaceable, numbered scripts to
  provide max flexibility

I'm still hacking around with these three alternatives, trying to find the right balance.  If anyone has any preferences or fourth alternatives, feel free to discuss in #1.

For updates, either watch this repo or just follow me on twitter; I'll announce releases there.  - @stevegt
